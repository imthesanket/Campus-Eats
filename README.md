## Project Introduction
Food delivery services has became one of the concerning sector due to the Corona virus. Instead of hiring external people to deliver the food, local businesses are looking for simple ways to deliver the food to consumers. Even when things that were affected by Corona virus are returning to normal, many experts believe that food delivery will have become a part of our daily routine. Students prefer food delivery services while present in campus premises. University personnel dislike the constant influx of guests who may or may not be affiliated with the university. Although companies like UberEats and GrubHub are delighted to deliver on campus, many colleges are debating whether they should take control of the delivery and ensure that only students and approved university workers deliver food on campus for safety and health reasons.
